I have adaped this to use PostgreSQL rather than SQL Server. No reason other than I have never use PostgreSQL prior and SQL Server Express was not working on my laptop.

## Database Source
The database was switch to Adventureworks rather than AdventureworksLT. 
I found this guid on github to convert Adventureworks2014 to PostgreSQL here: https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres

It inclded a fun Ruby script to convert the source data csv. If you do not want to install Ruby you can use https://replit.com/ by uploading the script and .csv files. Return them with a quick download after processing.
